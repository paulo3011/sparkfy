# Data Pipelines with Airflow

__Introduction:__

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They want to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

To complete the project, __will be build four different operators that will stage the data, transform the data, and run checks on data quality__. All of the operators and task instances will run SQL statements against the Redshift database.

## Stage Operator

The stage operator is expected to be able to load any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters should specify where in S3 the file is loaded and what is the target table.

The parameters should be used to distinguish between JSON file. Another important requirement of the stage operator is containing a templated field that allows it to load timestamped files from S3 based on the execution time and run backfills.

## Fact and Dimension Operators

Most of the logic is within the SQL transformations and the operator is expected to take as input a SQL statement and target database on which to run the query against. Also can be define a target table that will contain the results of the transformation.

Dimension loads are often done with the truncate-insert pattern where the target table is emptied before the load. Thus, will be create a parameter that allows switching between insert modes when loading dimensions. Fact tables are usually so massive that they should only allow append type functionality.

## Data Quality Operator

The final operator is the data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result needs to be checked and if there is no match, the operator should raise an exception and the task should retry and fail eventually.

For example one test could be a SQL statement that checks if certain column contains NULL values by counting all the rows that have NULL in the column. We do not want to have any NULLs so expected result would be 0 and the test would compare the SQL statement's outcome to the expected result.

__This project includes three files:__

- README.md Provide details about this project.

__Project Datasets:__

- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

__Song Dataset:__

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset:

```txt
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

__Log Dataset:__

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```txt
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

```json
{"artist":null,"auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Walter","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Frye","length":null,"level":"free","location":"San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA","method":"GET","page":"Home","registration":1540919166796.0,"sessionId":38,"song":null,"status":200,"ts":1541105830796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"39"}
{"artist":"Des'ree","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Kaylee","gender":"F","itemInSession":1,"lastName":"Summers","length":246.30812,"level":"free","location":"Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540344794796.0,"sessionId":139,"song":"You Gotta Be","status":200,"ts":1541106106796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/35.0.1916.153 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"8"}
```
